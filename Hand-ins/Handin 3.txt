2015 Problem 2:
    P1: (240, 480)
    P2: (140, 300)

    delx = 140 - 240 = -100
    dely = 300 - 480 = -180

          l r t b
    C1 = [0 0 1 0]
    C2 = [1 0 0 0]


    P1 outside
	Above:
	    P1.x = P1.x + (W.t - P1.y) * dely / delx = 240 + (400 - 480) * 1.8 = 96 
    	    P1.y = W.t = 400 

    End of Pass1: P1 = (96, 400), P2 = (140, 300)


    Pass2: C1 = [1 0 0 0] C2 = [1 0 0 0]
    TRIVIAL REJECT

    The line has no endpoint
