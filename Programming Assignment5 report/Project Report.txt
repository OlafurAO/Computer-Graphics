===================
The Game
===================
Survival FPS game.

You control a character with an assortment of weapons at his 
disposal, trying to survive against a horde of monsters. If 
you get hit by a monster 3 times, you die and the game 
is over. Monster spawn points are initialized at the 
beginning of the game and a new monster will spawn at one of 
them every 3 seconds or so. The monsters are quite slow but 
it's easy to get snuck up on if you neglect to look
behind you. You can also be unlucky enough to be standing on 
a monster's spawn point when it appears, so it's best to be 
on the move the entire time. The monsters have 5 hitpoints.

==========================
Stuff I'd like to have done/fixed (given more time)
==========================
- Fix the health bar, it gets messed up when weapons
  other than the pistol is selected.

- Have an actual level instead of just one big room

- Have the player start with just the pistol
  and make him have to collect better weapons 
  throughout the game

- Have some more interesting weapons, maybe area
  of effect ones like grenades.

- Have ammo and a reload mechanic to make the game
  more challenging.

- Have more interesting environments instead of just walls

- Texture map the enemies properly

- Have more enemy variety

- Make the enemy AI smarter and implement wall collision
  for the enemies. 

- Make the game more graphically appealing, better lighting,
  maybe a flashlight mechanic.

- Have an indicator for when enemies get hurt, they could
  for example flash red or make a noise. Maybe also display
  a health bar above their heads.
